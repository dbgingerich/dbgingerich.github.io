---

Dr. Daniel B. Gingerich is an Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the National Energy Technology Laboratory and Post-Doctoral Research with the [WE3 Lab](https://we3lab.com/) in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at Stanford University.  His work focuses on developing models to quantify the environmental impact of energy generation and water treatment systems to assist in the development of holistic regulatory analyses that address air, water, and solid waste simultaneously.

Starting in January 2020, Dr. Gingerich will be an Assistant Professor in the Departments of [Civil, Environmental, and Geodetic Engineering](https://ceg.osu.edu/about/cege-glance) and [Integrated Systems Engineering](https://ise.osu.edu/about/welcome-ise-ohio-state) at The Ohio State University.  Daniel will also be a Core Faculty member of the [Sustainability Institute](https://si.osu.edu/) at Ohio State.  His research at OSU will focus on creating resilient water and energy infrastructure by identifying new processes, evaluating policies, and creating people-focused solutions.

Dr. Gingerich recieved his Ph.D. from the [Department of Engineering and Public Policy](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/) at Carnegie Mellon University in August 2017.  His thesis work focused on evaluating risk trade-offs between air and water pollution and modeling emerging technologies that avoid these trade-offs.  After his Ph.D., Daniel worked as a Post-Doctoral Research Associate in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.  He received an M.S. in Civil Engineering (Environmetnal Concentration) from Auburn University and a B.S. in Civil Engineering and a B.A. in Political Science from Mississippi State University.

When not doing research, Daniel can be found reading yet another short-story collection, baking in the kitchen, or exploring the Bay Area.
