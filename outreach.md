# K-12 Outreach
## SUCCEED

Every summer, the Center for [Climate and Energy Decision Making](https://cedmcenter.org/) hosts SUCCEED.  [SUCCEED](https://cedmcenter.org/succeed/succeed-student-program/) is a co-educational program targeting rising sophomores and juniors considering careers in STEM fields and teaches them about energy, the environment and climate change.

For the six summers I was at Carnegie Mellon, I taught or co-taught lessons on the Energy-Water Nexus, Ocean Acidification, Life-Cycle Assessment, and Air and Water Pollution.  The Energy-Water Nexus was a particular favorite and it was a capstone lecture that builds off of previous lessons on energy systems, life-cycle assessment, air pollution, and water pollution.  For the 2016 iteration, I walked students through the calculations involved in [my research](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/8/1862) performing a life-cycle assessment of flue gas desulfurization wastewater.
