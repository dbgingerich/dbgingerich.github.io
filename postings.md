subtitle:  Water and Energy Socio-Technical Systems (WESTS) Team
---

The *Water and Energy Socio-Technical Systems (WESTS) Team* works at the intersection of engineering and society, finding ways to create and translate engineering knowledge to policy-relevant, actionable information.  In particular, we work on designing the energy and water systems of the future by:
- identifying and evaluating new *processes* that we need;
- applying the analytical frameworks to explore the *policies* that will get us there; and
- working with the *people* that are impacted by these innovations.

As I get started at Ohio State University, I am looking to recruit a Ph.D. student to work on the deisgn and evaluation of resilient water infrastructure.  Students interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in either Civil, Environmental and Geodetic Engineering or Integrated Systems Engineering should [email me](gingerich.62@osu.edu) with their CV and a brief statement of interest.
