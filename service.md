# Service to the University

## CMU Graduate Student Assembly

While a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, I was heavily involved in the [Carnegie Mellon University Graduate Student Assembly](https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/).  I served as a GSA Representative for the Department of Engineering and Public Policy (2014-2015), Vice President of External Affairs (2015-2016), and President (2016-2017). In these roles I sat on a variety of committees, including:
- President's Student Advisory Council
- Provost's Graduate Advisory Board
- Task Force on the CMU Student Experience - Mental Health and Wellbeing Working Group

I was also on the GSA Executive Committee for the first two years of the [2015-2025 GSA Strategic Plan](https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/About-the-GSA/Strategic-Plan.html).  As part of the work in the Strategic Plan, I worked to update our governing documents, creating new positions within the Executive Committee, and advocated for the needs of a diverse graduate student body.

## Call to Action

In the fall of 2015, a group of students came together at Carnegie Mellon Univresity to call the community to be better on issues of race and diversity.  I was an active member of this group while at CMU, since shortly after its first meeting.  As part of that group, I've organized meta-curricular experiences for students to discuss their experiences at CMU, facilitated discussions on how to improve the CMU experience for its diverse student body, and served as a resource panelist as part a deliberative democracy event on diversity and inclusion at CMU.
